# BoilerPenguin
## A set of html/css/js templates to get coding going faster. This boilerplate can help get projects get going faster, or setup sandbox files quicker to test new techniques.

### Markup

The markup is cleanm, semantic html5.

### LESS

The LESS superset of CSS brings a lot of functionality to CSS that developers have been wanting: variables, functions, nested selectors... as a whole LESS enables faster css development, leaner CSS files, and a more enjoyable development process in general. As such, BoilerPenguin is centered around LESS.

### Normalize vs. Eric Meyer

Eric Meyer's global css reset has been the long standard in the css reset world. Normalize is quickly gaining traction though, so I've included both as there are great things about both approaches. I haven't yet settled on switching to Normalize from Eric Meyer's reset yet, and I imagine others might want to try out both as well.
